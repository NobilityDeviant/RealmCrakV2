# RealmCrakV2
RealmoftheMadGod's worst enemy.

RealmCrak is an account checker for RealmOfTheMadGod. (ROTMG)
It is now FREE for anyone to use however they like.

Coded in Java 8. You need java 8 to use it: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

JDK 8 is needed to edit it: https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All

I use IntelliJ as an IDE: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/ - The Community Version will work just fine.

You can download it here: https://github.com/NobilityDeviant/RealmCrakV2/releases

Or you can compile the jar yourself.

Since this program is not what I want to showcase going forward, there will be no documentation.
If you have any questions you can email me at nobilitydev@protonmail.com
